## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of house prices. We will explore the relationships between different features and house prices, and build predictive models to estimate house prices based on these features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains various features of houses and their corresponding prices. The dataset is loaded and analyzed in the Jupyter notebook `Analysis on House Price Dataset.ipynb`.

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you need the following packages:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
